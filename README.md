# ES6
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use ES6 in my projects for the first time.

There were 4 Tasks - a new branch on each was created.

Branch Task1 - creating a simple script to practice ES6 syntax (joining strings, arrow functions, rest parameters, spread operator, spliting arrays).

Branch Task2 - creating a simple app - stopwatch (using ES6 syntax).

Branch Task3 - modifying the app from Task2 (stopwatch) using React and ES6.

Branch Task4 - creating an app to search github users using React and ES6 syntax.
